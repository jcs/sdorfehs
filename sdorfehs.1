.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a window manager without fat library dependencies, fancy graphics or
dependence on a mouse.
.Pp
The screen can be split into non-overlapping frames.
All windows are kept maximized inside their frames.
.Pp
All interaction with the window manager is done through keystrokes.
.Nm
has a prefix map to minimize key clobbering.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Bs
.It Fl c Ar command
Send
.Nm
a command.
There must be a
.Nm
instance running as window manager for the given display/screen for this to
work.
Do not forget to quote the command if it contains spaces.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl Nm Fl c Qq Ar "echo hello world"
.It Fl d Ar display
Set the X display to use or send commands to.
.It Fl f Ar filename
Specify an alternate configuration file.
If this is not given,
.Nm
will try
.Pa $HOME/.config/sdorfehs/config
and execute each command when starting up.
.It Fl h
Show summary of options.
.It Fl i
Execute commands given with
.Fl c
in interactive mode.
That means it will behave exactly as if called with
.Ic C\-a \&:
like prompting for missing arguments and things like that.
.It Fl s Ar number
Only use the specified screen.
.El
.Sh KEY BINDINGS

.Nm
to
.Ar directory .
If nothing is given, change it to the value of the environment variable
.Qq Ev HOME .
.It Ic clrunmanaged

Like
.Ic prev
but switch to the previous window with another resource class than the
current one.
(That means the previous window belonging to another type of application
than the current one.)

containing all the normal commands.
.Pp
Note that you have to describe ":" by "colon", "!" by "exclam" and so on.

and look at the error message, or try
.Ic :describekey Li root
and pressing the key.
.It Ic dedicate Op Cm 0 | 1
Consider the current frame dedicated/chaste
.Pq Cm 1
or promiscuous
.Pq Cm 0 .
.Pp
A dedicated frame will not accept new windows.

binding
in
.Li root
to
.Ar key ,
and
.Ic meta
binding in
.Li root
to
.Ar key
without modifiers or
.Ic "C\-" Ns Ar key
if
.Ar key
has no modifiers.
(If
.Ic set Ar topkmap
was called with an argument other than
.Ar top
that will be used instead of
.Ar top . )

instead of the frame active when
.Nm
gets this command.
.It Ic execf Ar frame shell\-command
Spawn a shell executing
.Ar shell\-command ,
showing _NET_WM_PID supporting programs in the given frame instead of
the frame selected when this program is run.

If an argument is supplied, switch to a frame given by number
.Ar frameno .
.Pp
If no argument is given, show a frame selector in each frame and wait for
a key to be pressed.

.Ar variable .
.It Ic getsel

.It Ic hsplit Oo Ar l Ns Li / Ns Ar p | Oo Li \- Oc Ns Ar pixels Oc Pq Ic C\-a S
Split the current frame into left frame and a right frame.
If no parameter is given, split in halves.

Otherwise the right half is
.Ar pixels
wide or the left one is

wide, depending whether there is
.Ql \-

but switch to the previous window with the same resource class as the
current one.

.Ic addhook
to be executed when even
.Ar event
occurs.
.It Ic meta Oo Ar key Oc Pq Ic C\-a t
Send the escape key (that which normally is
.Ic C\-a )
to the current window.
If a
.Ar key
is specified, this is sent instead.
Note that some applications by default ignore the synthetic key that is
sent using this command as it is considered a security hole.
xterm is one such application.
.It Ic newkmap Ar keymap
Generate a new keymap named
.Ar keymap .
This keymap can be used to add new key-command mappings to it with
.Ic definekey
and can be called with
.Ic readkey .
.It Ic next Pq Ic C\-a Return | C\-a n | C\-a space
Switch to the next window in the current vscreen.
.It Ic nextscreen Pq Ic C\-a N

.It Ic other Pq Ic C\-a C\-a
Switch to the window of the current vscreen that was last
accessed but is not currently visible.
.It Ic prev Pq Ic C\-a p
Switch to the previous window in the current vscreen.
.It Ic prevscreen Pq Ic C\-a P
Switch to the previous screen. (If you have multiple physical ones.)
.It Ic prompt Op Ar prompt
.Nm
will ask the user for input, showing

user has made.
Note that this command probably does not make much sense in interactive
mode.
.It Ic putsel Ar x\-selection
Replace the X selection with the text
.Ar x\-selection .
It can be inserted into the current window with
.Ic getsel .
.It Ic quit
Quit
.Nm .
.It Ic ratinfo

in
.Ar keymap .
To show it is waiting for a key,
.Nm
will change the rat cursor to a square if
.Va waitcursor
is set.
This command is perhaps best described with its usage in the default
configuration: by pressing
.Ic C\-a ,
which is the only key in the keymap
top ,
the command
.Qq Ic readkey Ar root
is executed.
The next key then executes the command in keymap
.Li root
belonging to
this command.
.It Ic redisplay Pq Ic C\-a l
Extend the current window to the whole size of its current frame and
redisplay it.
(Useful to redisplay normal windows or bring transient windows to the
full size of the frame as only normal windows are maximized by
.Nm )
.It Ic redo Pq Ic C\-a U
Revert the last
.Ic undo
of frame changes.
.It Ic remhook Ar event command
Remove command
.Ar command
from the list of commands to be called when event

.Ar variable
to
.Ar value .
.Po
Environment variables will be passed to all programs started from
