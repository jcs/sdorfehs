Shawn Betts (sabetts@users.sourceforge.net)

Shawn is the original author and current maintainer for
ratpoison. Sickened by the rat and the trend in window managers, he
sat down one evening and pulled an all-nighter writing the first
version of ratpoison.

Ryan Yeske (rcyeske@vcn.bc.ca)

Ryan doesn't commit much code these days, but that's not because he
doesn't want to, its just that he forgot his cvs ssh password.
Meanwhile, the patches are piling up.
