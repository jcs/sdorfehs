Ratpoison - Say good-bye to the rodent
--------------------------------------

About
-----

ratpoison is a simple Window Manager with no fat library dependencies,
no fancy graphics, no window decorations, and no flashy wank. It is
largely modelled after GNU Screen which has done wonders in virtual
terminal market.

All interaction with the window manager is done through
keystrokes. ratpoison has a prefix map to minimize the key clobbering
that cripples EMACS and other quality pieces of software.

--------

ratpoison uses autoconf. To build it:

$ ./configure && make

if you want to install it, simply type 'make install' as a privileged user:

# make install

emulator to use. The default is `xterm'.
